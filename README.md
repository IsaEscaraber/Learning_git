![write the description of the img inside the bracket](url)
***

* ## LINK
It's the same as the image, but without the ! at the beginning.
[white the description of the link](url)
***

* ## TABLES
To create a table you need to use a vertical bar between the words, forming columns,
and three dashes, one pipe ... depending on the quantity of the columns to create a line.

Numb|Name|Age|Address
---|---|---|---
1|Isa|25|Curitiba
2|Danilo|27|Londrina
3|Catherine|31|Canada

To finish the table we can write some on the bottom.
***

* ## COMMAND
To highlight a command in the text, you must use a grave accent.

we can use this cmd of JS `document.getElementById()` in the middle of any sentence, leaving it monospaced and with a light gray background.
Or this one of Python.

```
num = int(input('Type the value:')
if num%2==0:
        print(f'The value{num}is EVEN')
else:
        print(f'The value{numb}is ODD'))
```

Or just add a printscreen of the code.
***

* ## EMOJIS
This code is used in writes comment of README or issues description.

The names of the emoji is the repository of ikatyang.
