BRANCH = ramos

-MASTER is the main branch, like a tree trunk;
-Look like a tree;
-Commit is a new version, everytime when to commit in the master is created a version, it means to saving in a local repository;
-After that, needed to make a push to send from the local to the remote repository;
-ORIGIN is a backup in the remote repository (github);
-Must to avoid to commit only in a master branck;
- The ideal is to created a new branch to add a new feature, because it is risk to save in the main branch, that is a master, it can be irreversible;
-Need to create a new branch to each feature, ex: design, back, front...;
-During the creation af the feature in each branch, will be necessary some commits, but it won't be on the master;
-For that is necessary to make a merge;
-MERGE is a unification of the information between the new branch to the master branch;
-New branchs can be deleted normally;
-If some conflicts appear, the github will warn automatically before the merge;
