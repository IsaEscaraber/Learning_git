ISSUES = PROBLEMS, SITUATIONS

- Generally the users localise and don't know how to fix;
- First step is trying to find the problem already created by other user before to create a new issue on Github;
-Search first of all
- Comment the problem or try to solve and answering the others.
- Helping people and the ower of the repository to get the solution.
- This help is just to commenting or showing with images, links, etc...


PULL REQUEST = COPY THE CODE

- Copy the code, fix it and send to the onwer;
- We can use fork to do that;
- The ower of the repository can choose if will accept your correction or not;
- If we know how to fix the issue, we can make a fork and fix the code, after send to the onwer;
